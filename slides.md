## What is CodeRefinery

[RB drafts this, 5 minutes]

- What is CodeRefinery?
- How does it relate to Carpentries?
- Lightning slide-deck (3 slides, link to web)
- Audience: our audience is not mostly pure beginners
- Ask Question via HackMD:
  - Is there a need for more intermediate/advanced Carpentries-style
    material for learners who have completed a basic Carpentries
    training?
  - What topics/courses are needed?

## A vision of reaching many people at once

[RD drafts this, 2+10+3 minutes]

- What was a Mega-Workshop? and why?
- Why you would want to - the promise of technology reaching everyone.
- Why you need a vision (Mega-Coderefinery vs HPC kickstart)
- You can get even *more* out of it
- Question to audience via breakout room, answers in HackMD:
  - How can large be more inclusive?  How is it less?
  - What technical obstacles does it have?
- Do we discuss results in main room?

## "lecture and exercises"

[not sure this is the right name, it's not quite "filpped classroom", what is it?]

[AF drafts this, 2 minutes]

- short lectures and "asynchronous Q&A" in main room
- exercises more in the breakout rooms among groups

---

## Collaborative notes

- Use of HackMD for collection of Q&A regarding lesson contents
<ul style="list-style-type:' \002B \0020 \0020'">
  <li> It keeps record of Q&A so that it is possible to review afterwards.</li>
  <li> Main flow is not disrupted.</li>
  <li> Stable most of the time with 50-100 users (depending on the edit history length).</li>
</ul>

- For short communications for more practical questions, we used Zoom chat function.

# Role presentations

<!--NT will moderate this session, 20 minutes　-->

<!-- - They should: say what the role is, why the role is important, say what -->
<!--   you thought, what went well, what should be improved.  Please also check -->
<!--   what the other roles are, so that you can focus on what makes your role -->
<!--   special -->
<!--     - one slide per role -->
<!--     - Naoe starts this session by giving word to the speakers -->

## Helper

<!--Matúš, 2 minutes-->

<!-- If you're asking whether you can be a helper, you most likely can! -->

.left-column-70[
- Matúš Kalaš, University of Bergen (Norway)
- assigned a **breakout room**  <!-- Semi-stable breakout room assignment, with minimum changes of the "assigned" learners -->
- leads exercise work in their room, or just **helps the learners** therein and answers their questions  <!-- incl. indexing where we are / what we are doing, asking how it goes, etc. -->  <!-- "My" learners mostly preferred to work alone first & then ask questions if needed. Occasionally someone sharing their screen -->
- **forwards** interesting questions and difficult problems to HackMD or expert helpers
- depending on confidence with the exercises, needs only **minimum preparation** <br/><small>(so awesome that CR folks prepared everything so well!)</small>  <!-- Preparation as a helper recommended, but most of the time (would have) worked also without. I skipped preparation in one exercise (about what I do every day), and I managed to mess it up quite a bit :DD  All other exercises were smooth though. -->
- if 2 screens or fast in switching, a helper may help **answering** in HackMD and Zoom chat <br/><small>(there are also optional advanced exercises in CR, and advanced topics to discuss in HackMD)</small>  <!-- If without an extra screen (recommended but not mandatory), I personally wouldn't have been able to follow hackMD, and chat also not so much. But the helper work would still function just fine. -->
- **learns** a lot, feels useful, and has a lot of **fun** ;D  <!-- Much more fun to go through the teaching material as a helper than just following it alone (and to experience the whole workshop in its interactivity and excitement!) -->
<!-- Some improvement possibilities:
	- more explicit about suggested layouts of screen(s) for learners, possibly specific to a given lecture or exercise (also presenters taking that into account for their screen)
	- more explicit when & what helpers should prepare
-->

## Future outlook and Q&A session

[RB drafts this, 5-10 minutes]

---

<!-- 1-2 slides but q&a and "discussion" via hackmd -->

- Continue with online workshops even later - this is not "replacement to
  in-person" but much better in some ways
- Does this work in all audience types? Diversity, tech background.
- Encourage and accept lurkers more (better experience when streaming).
- How can we make a federated model via the stream? We don't know yet.
